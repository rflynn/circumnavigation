"So many turned upon Magellan that they knocked his helmet off his head twice... An Indian hurled a bamboo spear into the captain's face, but the latter immediately killed him with his lance, which he left in the Indian's body. Then, trying to lay hand on sword, he could draw it out but halfway, because he had been wounded in the arm with a bamboo spear. When the natives saw that, they all hurled themselves upon hi,. One of them wounded him on the left leg with a large cutlass, which resembled a scimtar, only larger. That caused the captain to fall face downward, when immediately they rushed upon him with iron and bamboo spears and with their cutlasses, until they killed our mirror, our light, our comfort, and our true guide. When they wounded hum, he turned back many times to see wether we were all in the boats. Thereupon, beholding him dead, we, wounded, retreated as best as we could to the boats, which were already pulling off..."
