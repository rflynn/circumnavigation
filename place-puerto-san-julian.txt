"Puerto San Julian still offers a spacious iner harbor, but a depressing aspect.
 The entrance between the hundred-foot-high gray cliffs (Cabos Curioso and Desengano)
 narrows to a half-mile-wide bottleneck.
 The tidal range is 20-25 feet and the current at the narrow entrance runs up to 6 knots.
 So, when things got sticky, Magellan found it wise to moor his flagship in the bottleneck
 so that any vessel trying to escape would have to cross his cannon range." -- Morison, p.367

There is a Nao Victoria museum in present day Puerto San Julian, Santa Cruz, Argentina
Relive Magellan’s landing at Museo Nao Victoria, a museum-cum-theme-park with life-sized figures cloaked in armor and shown celebrating Mass and battling mutiny. Reproductions of everyday items provide some interest. You can’t miss it – it’s at the port on a boat, a reproduction of the Nao Victoria.
