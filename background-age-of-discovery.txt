The term was first coined by the Florentine explorer Amerigo Vespucci, in a letter written to his patron Lorenzo di Pier Francesco de' Medici in the Spring of 1503, and published (in Latin) in 1503-04 under the title Mundus Novus. Vespucci's letter contains arguably the first explicit articulation in print of the hypothesis that the lands discovered by European navigators to the west were not the edges of Asia, but rather an entirely different continent, a "New World"
