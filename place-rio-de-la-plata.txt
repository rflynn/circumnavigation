in 1516 
	Juan Díaz de Solís (1470 – January 20, 1516) was a Spanish navigator and explorer
	whose small expedition to the Rio de la Plata was killed by natives
He became a Pilot-Major of Spain in 1512 following the death of Amerigo Vespucci,[5] and was thereafter commissioned to update the Padrón Real with Juan Vespucci.[6][7] Two years after appointment to this office, Díaz de Solís prepared an expedition to explore the southern part of the new continent. His three ships and crew of 70 men sailed from Sanlucar de Barrameda on October 8, 1515. He followed the eastern coast as far as the mouth of the Río de la Plata. He reached and named the Río de la Plata in 1516, sailing up river to the confluence of the Uruguay River and Paraná River with two officers and seven men.
The little party had not proceeded far when they were attacked by local Charrúa Indians. Surviving crew members reported Díaz de Solís and most of the other men were killed, thus putting the expedition to an end. His brother-in-law, Francisco de Torres, took charge of the ships and returned to Spain.

Isla de Lobos

	Isla de Lobos is a nature reserve because it has the largest colony of sea lions in the western hemisphere: in 2001 there were 180,000 sea lions of the species called "two hairs" and 6,500 of the species known as the "wig".
