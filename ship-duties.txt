master : responsible for the navigation of a sailing vessel, the rank can be equated to a professional seaman and specialist in navigation, rather than as a military commander.
	The master’s main duty was navigation, taking ship’s position daily and setting the sails as appropriate for the required course. During combat, he was stationed on the quarterdeck, next to the captain. The master was responsible for fitting out the ship, and making sure they had all the sailing supplies necessary for the voyage. The master also was in charge of stowing the hold and ensuring the ship was not too weighted down to sail effectively. The master, through his subordinates, hoisted and lowered the anchor, docked and undocked the ship, and inspected the ship daily for problems with the anchors, sails, masts, ropes, or pulleys. Issues were brought to the attention of the master, who would notify the captain. The master was in charge of the entry of parts of the official log such as weather, position, and expenditures.
	During the Age of Sail, the sailing master in the Royal Navy became the warrant officer trained specifically in navigation, was the senior warrant officer rank, and was the second most important officer aboard rated ships.[1] The master ate in the wardroom with the other officers, had a large cabin in the gunroom, and had a smaller day cabin next to the captain's cabin on the quarterdeck for charts and navigation equipment.
