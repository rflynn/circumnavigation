The liturgical year, also known as the church year, consists of the cycle of liturgical seasons in Christian churches which determines when feast days, including celebrations of saints, are to be observed, and which portions of Scripture are to be read. Distinct liturgical colours may appear in connection with different seasons of the liturgical year.

Crucifixion:
The crucifixion of Jesus: Jesus of Nazareth was condemned to crucifixion[82] (most likely in AD 30 or 33) by Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor of Iudaea province (see Responsibility for the death of Jesus for details). The civil charge was a claim to be King of the Jews.
Saint Peter, Christian apostle: according to tradition, Peter was crucified upside-down at his own request (hence the Cross of St. Peter), as he did not feel worthy to die the same way as Jesus.
Saint Andrew, Christian apostle and Saint Peter's brother: crucified, according to tradition, on an X-shaped cross, hence the name St. Andrew's Cross
