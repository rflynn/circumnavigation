Enrique de Malacca / Heinrich / Magellan's slave

Where is he originally from?

Pigafetta says he's from Sumatra
	Could someone from Sumatra communiate with those on Mazaua or Cebu?
		Moris says no: he says Filipinos say Sumatrans can't speak to Visays
			potentially he may have been captured previously by slavers and brought to Malacca

	Acquired by Magellan in Malacca (present day Indonesian city "Melaka" between Kuala Lampur and Singapore)
	Freed after Magellan's death
	Organizes betrayal at Cebu, stays there
	Eventually travels home to Malacca?
	Some argue he is the first person to circumnavigate the globe?
