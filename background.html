<h2>Spice Trade</h2>
<h4>Spice Consumption in Europe during the Renaissance</h4>
People in the Renaissance found many uses for spices. Pepper and other spices sifted through the fiber of Renaissance living.  The spice trade was basic to the Renaissance economy.  Pepper was used to preserve and to flavor spoiled meat.  Cloves and cinnamon was used as substitutes for cleanliness and ventilation.  They were strewn across the floor to prevent foot odor from permeating the room.  People carried around pieces of nutmeg fitted with a tiny grater, ready to season unsavory, unpalatable food.  Around many a Renaissance throat there hung spicy pomander to ward off suffocation, illness, and/or odor.  Spices also played an important role in literature.  We find references to spices in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Thousand_and_One_Nights">The Arabian Nights</a>, and even William Shakespeare’s works.

<h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illuminated_manuscript">Illuminated manuscript</a></h2>
An illuminated manuscript is a manuscript in which the text is supplemented by the addition of decoration, such as decorated initials, borders (marginalia) and miniature illustrations. In the most strict definition of the term, an illuminated manuscript only refers to manuscripts decorated with gold or silver, but in both common usage and modern scholarship, the term is now used to refer to any decorated or illustrated manuscript from the Western traditions. Comparable Far Eastern works are always described as painted, as are Mesoamerican works. Islamic manuscripts may be referred to as illuminated, illustrated or painted, though using essentially the same techniques as Western works.
