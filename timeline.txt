1505 Mar    At the age of 25, Magellan enlisted in the fleet of 22 ships sent to host D. Francisco de Almeida as the first viceroy of Portuguese India. Although his name does not appear in the chronicles, it is known that he remained there eight years, in Goa, Cochin and Quilon.
1506        Magellan participated in battle of Cannanore where he was wounded
1508		sailed in a fleet of four ships from Cochin on the Malabar coast to Malacca. -- Southern Voyages, Morison p316
1509        he fought in the battle of Diu[3] and later sailed under Diogo Lopes de Sequeira in the first Portuguese embassy to Malacca, with Francisco Serrão, his friend and possibly cousin.
1509 Sep    after arriving at Malacca, the expedition fell victim to a conspiracy ending in retreat. Magellan had a crucial role, warning Sequeira and saving Francisco Serrão, who had landed. This performance earned him honors and a promotion.
			Here Magellan distinguished himself by giving warning of a Malay plot to capture the ships when most of their crew was ashore, and thereby thwarting it. -- Moris
1510 Jan    2 ships of a homeward convoy from Cochin with Magellan on board, struck on the Padre shoals near the Maldive Islands. Magellan took command, sent the ships' boats with the captains and gentlemen passengers to Cannanore -- a journey of 8 days -- and himself remained in charge of the 2 wrecks with the greater part of the crews. They, but for confidence in him, would have rushed the boats to get away, or starved. During the several weeks before a rescue vessel arrived, Magellan had the wrecked hulls, shored up for safety, kept constant watch against a pirate attack, took care that rations were served out fairly and there was no pilfering of the valuable cargo. It was considered so remarkable for an officer to do that instead of saving himself that even historians who considered him a traitor to Portugal praised his courage and his men's loyalty. Magellan was always a sailor's sailor, and "os rudos marinheiros" (the rough sailors), as Camöens called the common "matlow" of that era, always stood by him in his contests with officers. -- Moris p316
1511        Governor Afonso de Albuquerque sent a fleet under Antonio d'Abreu to conquer Malacca and Magellan and Serrão participated. Malacca fell after a siege of six weeks. Here the Portuguese received breath-taking accounts of the Spice Islands (the Moluccas). Albuquerque decided without delay to reconnoiter this spicy paradise.
			Three ships were equipped: Abreu commanded Santa Catarina, Serrão the Sabaia and Magellan a caravel. With help of a local pilot they reached Ambon and Banda. Nutmegs were plentiful and Abreu loaded up and went back to Malacca. -- Morris p.317
			Serrão's vessel struct a reef and became a total loss. By a ruse he captured the vessel of some pirates who were looking for him, and in her sailed back to Ambon and on to Ternate. Thence he wrote enthusiastic letters to his friend Magellan about the amenities of the Spice Islands and the abundance of clove, cinammon and nutmeg.
		
1512        in the company of a Malay he had indentured and baptized Enrique of Malacca, returned to Portugal. Serrão departed in the first expedition sent to find the "Spice Islands" in the Moluccas, where he remained, having married a woman from Amboina and becoming a military advisor to the Sultan of Ternate, Bayan Sirrullah. His letters to Magellan would prove decisive, giving information about the spice-producing territories.
1513        King Manual launches an enormous army to enforce annual tribute from the Morrocan city of Azamor
            Magellan buys his own horse, an old one, the only one he can afford
			Portugal reclaims the city, but Magellan barely escapes with his life and his horse is killed
			The army offers a pittance for his horse and Magellan writes an angry, insulting letter directly to King Manuel requesting compensation for his horse. The letter is summarily dismissed.
			Magellan stubbornly remains at his post, acquires a new horse somehow and participates in hand-to-hand skirmishes against desert Arabs who harass the Portugese guarding Azamor
			Limp: Magellan an Arab lance smashes his kneecap, ending his career as a soldier
			Promoted to quartermaster, giving him a share of the spoils of war.
			Subsequent battle captures 200,000 Arab goats, camels, horses. Magellan distributes spoils, some to pay off tribal allies
			Compare : Don Quixote
After taking a leave without permission, Magellan fell out of favour. Serving in Morocco he was wounded and got a permanent limp. He was also accused of trading illegally with the Moors. The accusations were proved false, but there were no further offers of employment after May 15, 1514.
1515        he got an employment offer as a crew member on a Portuguese ship, but rejected
1517 Sep    Magellan asked Manuel if he could offer his services, Manuel said he could do as he pleased.
            Magellan knelt to kiss the king's hands, as custom dictated, King Manuel concealed them behind his cloak and turned his back on his petitioner
after a quarrel with King Manuel I, who denied his persistent demands to lead an expedition to reach the spice islands from the east, he left for Spain. In Seville he befriended his countryman Diogo Barbosa and soon married his daughter by second wife María Caldera Beatriz Barbosa[9] having had two children: Rodrigo de Magalhães[10] and Carlos de Magalhães, both of whom died at a young age.
Meanwhile he devoted himself to studying the most recent charts, investigating, in partnership with cosmographer Rui Faleiro, a gateway from the Atlantic to the South Pacific and the possibility of the Moluccas being Spanish according to the demarcation of the Treaty of Tordesillas.
