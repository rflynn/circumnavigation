Brazil and Portugal
In Portugal, Brazil and other parts of the Portuguese Empire, there were several units called league (Portuguese: légua):

Légua of 18 by degree = 6,172.4 metres
Légua of 20 by degree = 5,555.56 metres (Maritime légua)
Légua of 25 by degree = 4,444.44 metres
The names of the several léguas referred to the number of units that made the length corresponding to an angle degree of a meridian arc.

As a transitory measure, after Portugal adopted the metric system, the metric légua, of 5.0 km, was used.

In Brazil, légua is still used occasionally in the country, where it has been described as about 6.6 km.
