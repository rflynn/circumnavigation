"No contemporary painting or model can be identified as one of them. Victoria does indeed
appear crossing the Pacific, winged Victory perched on her bowsprit, in Ortelius's atlas
of 1589, but she has two masts and is of a later design than any Magellanic ship." -- Morison, p.342

Navigating
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

maps / charts / globes
	top secret
	varying degrees of wrong

calculate latitude was relatively reliable, longitude was not

Sounding bottom
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

dipsey lead
	A deep-sea lead.
	modern: A sinker attached to a fishing line; also, a line having several branches, each with such a sinker, used in deep-sea fishing.

heaving the lead
	From later reports we know that “heaving the lead” was a standard procedure as a ship sailed into harbor. A sailor (the “leadsman”) would throw the sounding lead as far forward as he could, and when the ship came up to where the lead had landed he would count the knots or markings on the lead line and call out the depth of the water to the pilot.

Daily Routines
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The crew was divided into three watches which would rotate throughout the night.

A strict hierarchy was maintained among the crew, and the duties of a sailor varied according to his position.



sleeping
	officers had cabins
	sailors sleep on the deck
		"At sea, sleep became the ultimate luxury, a solace nearly impossible to come by.
		The crew took naps whenever they could, night or day. Hammocks had yet to be introduced
		on board ships, so exhausted sailors appropriated a plank, or better still, a sheltered
		area of the deck where they could sprawl. They eased the wood's bruising hardness with
		a straw pallet, and shielded themselves against the cold and wet with heavy blankets." -- Bergreen, p.106

turning the hourglasses for time-keeping

measuring position at noon

food preparation

Coastal sailing
	rule of thumb: "as many miles as fathoms"; i.e. 1 fathom of water per mile from shore : Morison p.364


Anchoring
	mostly at night off the coast of South America so they don't miss any straits

Communication
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

via lights at the back of Trindad (which sailed first)
	1 light: 
	2 light: 
	3 light: 
	4 light: 

firing artillery:
	as they leave Seville
	when they see land
	if they should stop(?)

"sounding trumpets"
	to announce Antonio de Coca made captain of the San Antonio in Cartagena's stead

Pests
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Pests were ubiquitous, an inescapable fact of life at sea."
Rats and mice infested every ship

Magellan's crew might have brought along a domestic creature new to Europe at the time -- the cat --
to hunt rodents, following the practice of the day, although no record confirms that they did.
	If they had a cat it would certainly have been eaten during the Pacific journey...
	one day it would just disappear.

"Domestic cats were spread throughout much of the rest of the world during the Age of Discovery, as they were carried on sailing ships to control shipboard rodents and as good-luck charms." -- Mason, I.L. (1984). Evolution of Domesticated Animals. Prentice Hall Press. ISBN 0582460468.

"...infested with maggots, which devoured the sails, rigging and even the sailors' clothing,
rendering them all useless..." -- Bergreen, p.214

teredos / Shipworms
	not worms at all, but rather a group of unusual saltwater clams with very small shells, notorious for boring into (and eventually destroying) wooden structures that are immersed in sea water, such as piers, docks and wooden ships. Sometimes called "termites of the sea", they are marine bivalve molluscs (Eulamellibranchiata) in the family Teredinidae, also often known as Teredo Worms.


Sailors
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
stored their gear in large chests: wooden plates, eating utensils, wine jug, playing cards and books
	books were submitted for approval and censored by the Casa (imposed by the Inquisition)
		most devotional: lives of saints, profiles of popes, accounts of miracles, prayers for recital
		popular stories: knights and damsels and villains
		a few histories: Marco Polo's 'Travels'

Medicine / Doctor
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
mostly extracted teeth

scurvy: what did they call it?
	gums get soft and weak
	hands and feet swell
	eventually blood vessels dissolve and you bleed to death internally
	officers didn't get it because they had preserved quince, which had vitamin c
	Vasco de Gama's crew suffered the first widespread outbreak and were given oranges
		by Arab traders, the men making a miraculous recovery; proving that Arabs were
		accustomed to long journeys, scurvy and knew the cure

Burials
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
dumped overboard... how did this go exactly?
how were officers vs. seamen treated, Christians vs. captives?

"Sailors, many of them suffering from the early stages of scurvy themselves and seeing their
own deaths foretold, wrapped the body in a remnant of an old, tattered sail, secured it with a rope
and tied cannonballs to the feet. A priest, and on occasion the captain, uttered a brief prayer;
two sailors lifted the corpse onto a plant, tilted it, and committed their crewmate's mortal
remains to the hungry sea." -- Bergreen, p.215

Interaction with land
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
During the Age of Discovery, ships released rabbits onto islands to provide a future food source for other travelers. They eventually multiplied out of control and cats were introduced to keep their numbers, and that of mice and rats, down. The cats tended to favor local species as they were ecologically naive and easier to hunt. Their numbers too increased dramatically and soon they colonised many areas and were seen as pests too. -- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feral_cat#History
