Carrack / Nao (ship)
Caravel

"No contemporary painting or model can be identified as one of them. Victoria does indeed
appear crossing the Pacfici, winged Victory perched on her bowsprit, in Ortelius's atlas
of 1589, but she has two masts and is of a later design than any Magellanic ship." -- Morison, p.342

Navigating
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

maps / charts / globes
	top secret
	varying degrees of wrong

calculate latitude was relatively reliable, longitude was not

Sounding bottom
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

dipsey lead
	A deep-sea lead.
	modern: A sinker attached to a fishing line; also, a line having several branches, each with such a sinker, used in deep-sea fishing.

heaving the lead
	From later reports we know that “heaving the lead” was a standard procedure as a ship sailed into harbor. A sailor (the “leadsman”) would throw the sounding lead as far forward as he could, and when the ship came up to where the lead had landed he would count the knots or markings on the lead line and call out the depth of the water to the pilot.

Daily Routines
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

sleeping
	officers had cabins
	sailors sleep on the deck

turning the hourglasses for time-keeping

measuring position at noon

food preparation

Coastal sailing
	rule of thumb: "as many miles as fathoms"; i.e. 1 fathom of water per mile from shore : Morison p.364


Anchoring
	mostly at night off the coast of South America so they don't miss any straits

Communication
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

via lights at the back of Trindad (which sailed first)
	1 light: 
	2 light: 
	3 light: 
	4 light: 

firing artillery:
	as they leave Seville
	when they see land
	if they should stop(?)

"sounding trumpets"
	to announce Antonio de Coca made captain of the San Antonio in Cartagena's stead

Pests
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

teredos / Shipworms
	not worms at all, but rather a group of unusual saltwater clams with very small shells, notorious for boring into (and eventually destroying) wooden structures that are immersed in sea water, such as piers, docks and wooden ships. Sometimes called "termites of the sea", they are marine bivalve molluscs (Eulamellibranchiata) in the family Teredinidae, also often known as Teredo Worms.
