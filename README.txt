Overall goal: the telling of the Armada de Mulucca's global circumnavigation and the lives of the men involved. research and initial story should be comprehensive, but with an eye toward adapting it to a graphic novel and screenplay

Imagine the greatest single achievement on the sea told in Watchmen-style.

Storytelling:
	This story is a complex one, involving many individuals and cultures and locations around the globe.

		"If you want Calculon to race to the laser gun battle in his hover-Ferarri, press 1.
		 If you want Calculon to double-check his paperwork, press 2." -- Futurama

	The goal is to hint at enough of this complexity to do the story justice, while maintaining a
	sufficiently-paced narrative. We don't want to gloss over details that help fill in the setting,
	the people and the events; but we don't want to get bogged down either. I don't want to alter
	history, but I do want to tell it in a compelling way.

	I would like to tell the events of the Armada de Moluccas in a mostly linear fashion, but 
	fill in some of the time at sea and at rest with character backstory via the memories and dreams
	of the men on the voyage, especially Magellan. I think this will allow us to get right to the point
	of the story of the Armada while also doing character development. Bonus if we can weave the
	flashbacks in a way that a) the audience can make sense of and b) 

	For example, I want to put the torture and execution of Quesada in the perspective of the
	contemporary Spanish Inquisition.
	I want to explain Magellan's actions on the circumnavigation by way of the times in which he lived
	and the evidence we have of his personality on previous tours of duty... without this being
	a strict linear history of Spain or Portugal or even a biography of Magellan.

Proceed:
	Approximate timeline that breaks the story into manageable pieces by time and location

Questions:
	When did Magellan meet Rui Faleiro?
		Moris says they met in Portugal
		Bergreen says they met in Spain
	How does Juan de Aranda fit in exactly?
		Each story has a slightly different description of him and meeting arrangement...
			Does Magellan contact him or vice versa? Or does someone else bring him onboard?

	Firsthand:
		Antonio Pigafetta's journal: original lost, 3 copies in french, 1 in italian
			The account written by Antonio Pigafetta, the expedition's official chronicler and one of the survivors of the voyage, did not appear until 1525, in Paris, and was not wholly published until the first year of the 19th century; this was the edition by Carlo Amoretti published in 1800. This edition is now famously called the Ambrosiana codex. It is through Transylvanus' account that Europe was informed of the first circumnavigation of the globe.

Continuity

Things to Stress / How to show
	The age (Age of Discovery, Age of Sail)
		Ancient oar-propelled galleys were still in mainstream use
		State-of-the-art knowledge:
			Ptolemy's geography and astrology
			Pliny the Elder's 'Natural History'
		Maps/charts were top secret
		Cosmography maps the general features of the universe, describing both heaven and Earth
		Popular travel stories:
			The Travels of Marco Polo
			The Travels of Sir John Mandeville
			(Prester John)
		People were smaller : average height was 5'3"
			Sailors especially would be small, they also suffered malnutrition
		The Spanish Inquisition was ongoing, explains ethnocentrism, intolerence and torture
		Columbus had just discovered the Carribean only a generation before
		1519–21: Hernán Cortés leads the Spanish conquest of Mexico.
	Magellan's love for Christianity and for king and country and his overall passion and boldness
		contrast the repeated, cold dismissal by Manuel
	The insane value of cloves and spices: compare/contrast human life, gold, narcotics, etc.
		support by showing how awful food was without it, and how it was used in medicines, etc
		CONTRAST the wealth of the Spice Islands as reported in Serrao's letters
	The bitterness of the sea war between Spain and Portugal
		The fact that the Portugese sent ships out to seek and destroy them
	King Charles
		his youth
		chin deformity
		How little Charles cared for the men he sponsored, or cloves for that matter, only money and titles
	Magellan's character based on...
		military campaigns in his youth
	How much Magellan sacrificed before the journey even launched; he left behind...
		his country of birth and ~30 years of service
		his wife and child
		his friend Ruy Faleiro
	The danger of sailing
		demonstrate via Magellan and Serrao's histories of their ships striking reefs
	How cold it was in Patagonia
	The Fillipino pride over Magellan's defeat and death at Mactan
		every year they hold "Kadaugan sa Mactan" on Cebu (?) to commemorate Lapu Lapu's defeat
		Lapu-Lapu vs. Magellan in combat-style video game http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fDC3YA7Kww
	The legacy of Christianity in The Philippines
	The danger of traversing the Cape of Good Hope
		60 foot rogue waves(!)

Transitions during the story
	The insulation of persistent cultural society of upper-crust Europe to the exposure to the
		uncaring sea and land of undeveloped parts of the world
	The excitement of Magellan's time sailing the Indies 1505-1512, and his attempts to reunite with Serrao
	Francisco Serrão from Magellan's brother in arms to Spice Island then to death
		...imagine a Godfather-style power consolidation series between Ternate and Tidore
		Magellan's motivation is partly fueled by nostalgia for Serrão and the good times they had in their youth
	King Charles it's all about titles and thus money, the crew are expendable
		In 1519 Charles is ~18, when they return he is 21 and Holy Roman Emperor
		In 1521 he is negotiating to mary Manuel's daughter Isabel for political reasons
	Leadership: Magellan rules with a strong hand and singular vision, after his death the ships are not properly maintained and go astray
	The Eastern façade of the Cathedral of Seville was begun in 1519 and completed in 1522
	Rats are thrown overboard at first, but are eaten later as food runs out
	Magellan's religious fervor grows; up until Cebu/Mactan it is positive
		...begins conversions peacefully as a show of honor with great success, but eventually attacks anyone who DOESN'T convert

Climaxes:
	Tragic Mistake: Magellan's choice to sidetrack their mission to violently enforce Christianity upon the Mactan
	Point of No Return: When Magellan storms the Mactan sandbar/beach
	Downer Ending: most of the men die of malnutrition, Epinosa loses his ship, nearly half the remaining men are captured by the Portugese in the Verdes

Reveals
	Quesada mutiny
	the Strait
	Pacific side
	the true size of the Pacific
	Magellan's heavy-handedness in killing natives
	Portugal already had access to the Spice Islands, which is why Manuel repeatedly turned Magellan down

Temporal Juxtapositions
	Quesada's mutiny / the oath of loyalty by the officers in the church before they left

Perception / Symbology / Visual Stylistic Interpretation
	Magellan and Pigafetta have been compared to Don Quixote and Sancho Panza
	Show Patagonian people as actual giants as reported, or as ~6ft tall?
	When Magellan looks at the Southern Cross he sees a brighter, more-illuminated cross shape than others do
	When the ships finally reach Guam they form a skull
	When Magellan is fatally struck he briefly forms a cross

Practical questions:
	Tons of sailing ones
		How much draft did a carrack have?
		What was the process of scouting and landing at an island like?
			How deep did the water need to be?
			Anchoring
			How to measure depth, spot sandbars/reefs/etc
			How far would they row in?
			How many men would go ashore and how many would stay on the ship?
	Sailing course based...
		geography
		navigation
		currents
		winds
		maps

What do we learn about storytelling from history-based Hollywood film?
	Good: Braveheart, Gladiator, Troy, 300, The Last Samauri, Last of the Mohicans, The Patriot, Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves
		Script with heavy historical romantic revisions
		One or more large, violent, hand-to-hand battle scene
		Protagonist played by mainstream male Hollywood hunk
		A demonized antagonist  (except: Troy)
		Takes place 
	Bad: The Conqueror, Alexander, The Messenger: Joan of Arc, 1492: Conquest of Paradise
		Non-(straight white male) protagonist
		Absurdly miscast protagonist
		Overt homosexuality (Alexander)
	300: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/300_(comics)
		I'd like to go this route; producing a limited series of comic books
		Other non-superhero comics to be made into (good) films: Sin City, The Crow, Hellboy, V for Vendetta, Watchmen,
		Road to Perdition, From Hell, A History of Violence, Kick-Ass, Men in Black, (Mystery Men), Red, Tales from the Crypt, Timecop, 
	Related films: 1492 (beautiful visuals, terrible script)
	Magellan films/series:
		Films containing Ferdinand Magellan: http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0027108/
		Magellán (1977) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0125387/

In order to make this more Hollywood:
	Need to emphasize female roles and love
	Emphasize action

Scurvy
	Early symptoms are malaise and lethargy. After 1–3 months, patients develop shortness of breath and bone pain. Myalgias may occur because of reduced carnitine production. Other symptoms include skin changes with roughness, easy bruising and petechiae, gum disease, loosening of teeth, poor wound healing, and emotional changes. Dry mouth and dry eyes similar to Sjögren's syndrome may occur. In the late stages, jaundice, generalized edema, oliguria, neuropathy, fever, and convulsions, and eventual death are frequently seen.

Things:

The Santo Niño de Cebú ("Holy Child of Cebu") is a Roman Catholic figure of the Child Jesus highly similar to the Infant Jesus of Prague. Like the image's counterpart in Prague, the figure is clothed in expensive textile robes mostly donations from fervent devotees in the Philippines and abroad. The statue is permanently housed at the Basilica Minore del Santo Niño in Cebu City.
