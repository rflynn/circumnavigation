The trade was transformed by the European Age of Discovery, during which the spice trade, particularly in black pepper, became an influential activity for European traders. The route from Europe to the Indian Ocean via the Cape of Good Hope was pioneered by the Portuguese explorer navigator Vasco da Gama in 1498, resulting in new maritime routes for trade.
<p>
The economically important Silk Road (red) and spice trade routes (blue) blocked by the Ottoman Empire ca. 1453 with the fall of the Byzantine Empire, spurring exploration motivated initially by the finding of a sea route around Africa and triggering the Age of Discovery.

During the several weeks before a rescue vessel arrived, Magellan had the wrecked hulls shored up for safety, kept constant watch against a pirate attack, took care that rations were served out fairly and there was no pilfering of the valuable cargo. It was considered so remarkable for an officer to do that instead of saving himself that even historians who considered him a traitor to Portugal praised his courage and his men's loyalty. Magellan was always a sailor's sailor, and "os rudos marinheiros" (the rough sailors), as Camöens called the common "matlow" of that era, always stood by him in his contests with officers. -- Morison p.316

At Afonso d'Albequerque's Council of War...
<blockquote>
Fernan de Magalhaes said it seemed to him that the captain-major ought not to take the ships of burden
to Goa, isasmuch as if they went thither they could not pass this year to Portugal, since we are at the twelfth of October;
and that, making their shortest course without touching at Cananor, nor at any other port, it was not possible to lay
the fleet before the port of Goa before the eighth of November, as the winds were now contrary to that place: and with
respect to the crews, let his worship say whether it was well that they should go, that it seemed to him that he ought
not to take them, since there did not remain time for them to lay out their money, nor to do anything that was necessary
for their voyage -- Stanley, p.xxi

Conflict was unavoidable, and after 40 days of fighting, Malacca fell to the Portuguese on 24 August. -- Wikipedia
<p>
Governor Afonso de Albuquerque sent a fleet under Antonio d'Abreu to conquer Malacca and Magellan and Serrão participated. Malacca fell after a siege of six weeks. Here the Portuguese received breath-taking accounts of the Spice Islands (the Moluccas). Albuquerque decided without delay to reconnoiter this spicy paradise.

After taking a leave without permission, Magellan fell out of favour. Serving in Morocco he was wounded and got a permanent limp. He was also accused of trading illegally with the Moors. The accusations were proved false, but there were no further offers of employment after May 15, 1514.

<blockquote>
After this, Magellan appears to have left India, and
to have been stationed at Azamor in Morocco, where, in a skirmish with the Arabs, he was wounded in
the leg by a javelin, which left him somewhat lame.
When Joao Soarez, Captain of Azamor, left that place, and was succeeded by
D. Pedro de Sousa, Magellan left Azamor without leave from D. Pedro de Sousa, and came to Portugal;
his petition with regard to the increase of his palace
stipend had already been sent to D.Manuel; but

as he was accused. When he arrived there, as Barros
says, either because he was free from blame, or, as was
mostly asserted, because the frontier officers of Azanor,
in order not to vex him, would not accuse him, he
received a sentence of acquittal, and returned with it
to Portugal; but the king always bore ill-will to him,

We left them in the sea for 4-5 days, and then placed them for a few moments on top of

While at the Spanish Court reporting to Charles, Antonio passed his story to the Italian Pedagogue, Peter Martyr, who, in turn, instructed his acolyte, Maximillian of Translvania, the natural sone of the Cardinal Archbishop of Saltzburg, to write an account of the expedition in Latin for his father. That letter, dated October 24, 1522, was really the first international press release, unless one counts the Epistles of Paul. It was published in Cologne the following January, and later in Rome, and the story sent shock waves throughout Europe establishing a reputation and territorial claims for Spain plus eternal fame for the ill-fated Magellan. Thus although del Cano received considerable local acclaim at the time, he is lost to history and Antonio's client will be forever remembered.
<p>
Antonio's accounts of magellan's voyage contains the not unexpected publicist's hyperbole. He describes a rain-tree in Tenerife that was the sole source of potable water on the island, a tree around which a cloud formed each day at noon, and from whose roots water gushed into nearby cisterns! He tells of giants in Patagonia, provides glossaries of the languages of peoples visited, and reports on a bishop in the Moluccas with forty wives and venereal disease.
<p>
All in all, Antonio set high standards for us to follow. He was the first civilian to travel around the world, and he made his client's name an historical, if not a household word. A modest statue of our hero now stands in his hometown of Vicenza, and his name is footnoted or indexed in all accounts of Magellan.

<h3>Strait of Megallen</h3>
Within seven years it was being called Estrecho de Magallanes in honor of Magellan.[1] The Spanish Empire and the Captaincy General of Chile used it as the southern boundary of their territory. The first Spanish colony was established in 1584 by Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa, who founded Nombre de Jesús and Rey Don Felipe on the northern shore of the strait. These towns suffered severe food shortages, and when the English navigator Sir Thomas Cavendish landed at the site of Rey Don Felipe in 1587, he found only ruins of the settlement. He renamed the place Port Famine. Other early explorers included Francis Drake. The strait was first carefully explored and thoroughly charted by Phillip Parker King, who commanded the British survey vessel HMS Adventure, and in consort with HMS Beagle spent five years surveying the complex coasts around the strait. This survey was presented at a meeting of the Royal Geographical Society in 1831.

On November 6, 1521, the Moluccas, "cradle of all spices," were reached from the east by Magellan's fleet, sailing then under Juan Sebastián Elcano, at the service of the Spanish Crown. Before Magellan and Serrão could meet in the Moluccas, Serrão died on the island of Ternate, almost at the same time Magellan was killed in the battle of Mactan in the Philippines.[4]
<p>
After the Magellan expedition (1519–1522), Charles V sent an expedition led by García Jofre de Loaísa to colonize the islands, claiming that they were in his zone of the Treaty of Tordesillas.[5] The expedition reached with difficulty the Moluccas, docking at Tidore, where the Spanish later founded a fort. The conflict with the Portuguese already established in Ternate there was inevitable, resulting in the Spanish defeat after a year of fighting, starting nearly a decade of skirmishes over the possession.

Great Lisbon Earthquake, occurred in the Kingdom of Portugal on Saturday, 1 November 1755, the holiday of All Saints' Day, at around 09:40 local time.[1] In combination with subsequent fires and a tsunami, the earthquake almost totally destroyed Lisbon and adjoining areas. Seismologists today estimate the Lisbon earthquake had a magnitude in the range 8.5–9.0 on the moment magnitude scale,[2] with an epicentre in the Atlantic Ocean about 200 km (120 mi) west-southwest of Cape St. Vincent. Estimates place the death toll in Lisbon alone between 10,000 and 100,000 people,[3] making it one of the deadliest earthquakes in history.
