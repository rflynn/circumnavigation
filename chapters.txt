Given the contents of timeline.txt, this is a summary of how the story will be broken up into
issues / chapters.

The circumnavigation (Seville -> Seville) will be told linearly with little or no introduction --
I want action from the beginning.
The backstory will be filled in non-linearly, revealing enough to explain the journey as it moves
forward.
The key to the success of storytelling: character development, drama, suspense, pacing etc. will
be in dividing the chapters appropriately and filling in the right backstory at the right time.

Introductions:
	Religious enthusiasm: via Patagonia natives' interactions, via Magellan's dreams
	Beatriz family: flashbacks from Magellan; also in dreams
	Rui Faleiro: has given Magellan a (quadrant or map) with 'RF' on it

Non-linear sub-stories:
	Stories of sea monsters
	Prester John
	Marco Polo
	The Fall of Man
	The Spanish Inquisition
	The Odyssey
	Columbus
	King Charles rise to Emperor
	The Chinese Treasure Fleet?

How do we start? Perhaps tell it through Pigafetta's eyes... he wasn't a seaman, so we could "learn the ropes"
through him, he had a close relationship with Megallan and could have been his confidant, he was observant,
and most of all was enthusiastic about the trip!
