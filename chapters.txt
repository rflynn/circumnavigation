Given the contents of timeline.txt, this is a summary of how the story will be broken up into
issues / chapters.

The circumnavigation (Seville -> Seville) will be told linearly with little or no introduction --
I want action from the beginning.
The backstory will be filled in non-linearly, revealing enough to explain the journey as it moves
forward.
The key to the success of storytelling: character development, drama, suspense, pacing etc. will
be in dividing the chapters appropriately and filling in the right backstory at the right time.
