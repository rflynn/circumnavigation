Italian -- Il Milione ("The Million") or Oriente Poliano is a 13th-century travelogue written down by Rustichello da Pisa from stories told by Marco Polo, describing the travels of the latter through Asia, Persia, China, and Indonesia between 1271 and 1291.

<blockquote>
Many of the sailors on Magellan's voyage were familiar with it, and at least one brought
a copy of Polo's account along with him.

<div>1357-1371</div>

<blockquote>
...he deftly mixed accounts from ancient authors with what he claimed were his personal experiences
...he drew mich of his material directly from <em>Speculum Mundi</em>, a medieval encyclopedia,
which contained extracts from Pliny and Marco Polo, among other authorities
...he wove long passages from the Prester John letter
...trees that sprout at dawn, bear fruit by midday, and die before dusk
&mdash; Bergreen, p.81
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Mandeville argued that it was possible for people to circumnavigate the globe...
He proposed one man who had accomplished the trick. "He passed
India and so many isles beyond India, where there are more than
5,000 isles, and traveled so far by land and sea, girdling the globe,
that he found an isle where he heard his own language being spoken," Mandeville wrote.
"He marveled greatly, for he did not understand how that could be. But I conjecture
that he had traveled so far over land and sea, circumnavigating the earth, that he had come to
his own border; if he had gone a bit further, he would have come to
his own district. But after he heard that marvel, he could not get
transport any further, so he turned back the way he had come; so he
had a long journey!"
&mdash; Bergreen, p.81

<h2>Prester John (letter)</h2>

<blockquote>
It is difficult to overestimate the influence of this fabulous personage
&mdash; Bergreen, p.76
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
The legend originated in 1165 when a lengthy letter began to circulate
among various Christian leaders; as time passed, the letter
became more elaborate as anonymous authors added beguiling,
utterly fantastic details; so great was its appeal that it became one of the
most widely circulated and discussed documents of the Middle
Ages, translated in French, German, Russian, Hebrew, English,
among other languages, and with the introduction of movable type,
it was reprinted in countless editions.
&mdash; Bergreen, p.77
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Generous swaths of the Prester John letter found their way into
the two most popular travel books of the Middle Ages:
<em>The Travels of Marco Polo</em> and
<em>The Travels of Sir John Mandeville</em>,
lending credence to the travel accounts and to the Prester John legend.
&mdash; Bergreen, p.79
</blockquote>

<h2>Natural History</h2>

<blockquote>
Some of the most tenacious ideas about the world at large derived from
Pliny the Elder, who died in the eruption of Mount Visuvius in A.D. 79.
His multivolume, encyclopedic <em>Natural History</em>, rediscovered and widely
consulted in the Renaissance, sought to bring together everything that was known
about the natural world...
&mdash; Bergreen, p.74
</blockquote>

<h2>The Thousand and One Nights</h2>

<blockquote>
To the average person, the world beyond Europe resembled the fantastic realms
depicted in <em>The Thousand and One Nights</em>...
Going to sea was the most adventurous thing one could do, the Renaissance equivalent
of becoming an astronaut
&mdash; Bergreen, p.73
