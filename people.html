Though Spain was the core of his possessions, he was never totally assimilated and especially in his earlier years felt as if he were viewed as a foreign prince. He could not speak Spanish very well, as it was not his primary language. Nonetheless, he spent most of his life in Spain, including his final years in a Spanish monastery. Indeed, <b>Charles' motto, <em>Plus Ultra</em> ('Further Beyond'), became the national motto of Spain.</b>

"The king always loathed [Magellan]". -- Barros
	Nobody knows exactly why. -- Moris
<p>
Properties:

		Built by Manuel in ~1500
		
	loves architecture
	multiple wives
	lots of children
	residence:
<p>
Motivation for Magellan-loathing:
	paranoia; the king felt weak and feared anyone else appearing strong
		Magellan had always been bold (to a fault) in front of Manuel, and Manuel hated him for it
	failing health
	unhappy with his ungrateful son
<p>
During his reign important maritime expansion was occuring, creating a huge overseas empire
He spent his enormous wealth on...
	...architecture, so much so that the maritime-flavored style he favored is called "Manueline"
<p>
Wife died March 17
<p>
By 1517 had entered into the throes of a personal crisis.
He believed he was nearing the end of his reign; his adored wife had recently died in childbirth,
and he decided to abdicate in favor of his son (João). But the young man proved ungrateful,
Manuel adruptly changed his mind, decided to remain on the throne, and arranged to marry his son's
fiance Leonor, the 21-year-old sister of King Charles of Spain. All the while, it was rumored, she
continued to have relations with the boy, Prince Joao, a situation that caused no end of scandal
and derision at court. So the Portuguese sovereign whom Magellan petitioned with his ambitious
plan was a deeply suspicious, unhappy, and conflicted man -- a man determined to keep others from
attaining fame and power.
	-- Bergreen p.22-23

In December 1496, it was decreed that any Jew who did not convert to Christianity would be expelled from the country. However, those expelled could only leave the country in ships specified by the king. When those who chose expulsion arrived at the port in Lisbon, they were met by clerics and soldiers who used force, coercion, and promises in order to baptize them and prevent them from leaving the country. This period of time technically ended the presence of Jews in Portugal. Afterwards, all converted Jews and their descendants would be referred to as "New Christians", and they were given a grace period of thirty years in which no inquiries into their faith would be allowed; this was later extended to end in 1534.
A popular riot in 1504 ended in the death of two thousand Jews; the leaders of the riot were executed by Manuel.
Isabella died in childbirth in 1498, putting a damper on Portuguese ambitions to rule in Spain, which various rulers had harbored since the reign of King Ferdinand I (1367–1383). Manuel and Isabella's young son Miguel was for a period the heir apparent of Castile and Aragon, but his death in 1500 ended these ambitions. Manuel's next wife, Maria of Aragon, was his first wife's sister, but not the oldest surviving one. That was rather Joanna of Castile, who had issue.
In 1506 the Pope Julius II gave Manuel I a Golden Rose. Later in 1514 Pope Leo X also gave Manuel I a second Golden Rose. Manuel I became the first individual to receive more than one Golden Rose.

<div class="dob"></div>
a Portuguese cosmographer, astrologer, and astronomer who was the principal scientific organizer behind Magellan's circumnavigation of the world.
<p>
Born in Covilhã, Kingdom of Portugal, at the end of the fifteenth century, Faleiro and his brother Francisco Faleiro, also a cosmographer, served the Spanish king Charles I in Seville. Faleiro, one of the first to apply the most rigorously scientific method of determining latitude and longitude, had earlier served John II of Portugal and his successor, Manuel I of Portugal.
<p>
<p>
The merchant Christopher de Haro helped Faleiro and Magellan present their proposal before the Spanish royal counselors.
<p>
Faleiro planned to accompany Magellan on his voyage around the world. However, it is said that on the evening prior to embarkation, Faleiro worked out his own horoscope for the voyage. The stars predicted a violent death. Consequently, he remained behind. Other sources claim he went mad before the voyage, and thus did not join the expedition.
<blockquote>
Faleiro's trove consisted of 35 compasses, supplemented by an additional 15
devices that Magellan purchased in Seville; a wooden astrolabe constructed by Faleiro
himself; 6 metal astrolabes of a more common variety; 21 wooden quadrants; and 18
hourglasses, some of which Magellan purchased himself.
Then there were the charts, 24 in all, most of them top secret, all of them extremely
valuable... they were kept under lock and key, and under armed guard.
Of the total number of charts, 6 had been drafted by Faleiro.
18 others were the work of the cosmographer Nuno Garcia, 7 of these under the direction
of Faleiro and 11 more under the direction of Magellan
...the fleet also carried quantities of prepared blank parchment, as well as dried skins
to make still more parchment, if necessary, for additional maps.

Ferdinand Magellan (Portuguese: Fernão de Magalhães, IPA: [fɨɾˈnɐ̃w ðɨ mɐɣɐˈʎɐ̃jʃ]; Spanish: Fernando de Magallanes, IPA: [ferˈnando ðe maɣaˈʎanes]; c. 1480 – April 27, 1521) was a Portuguese explorer. He was born in Sabrosa, in northern Portugal, and served King Charles I of Spain in search of a westward route to the "Spice Islands" (modern Maluku Islands in Indonesia).
<p>
Father: Rodrigo de Magalhaes, minor nobility. honorary title of sheriff of the port of Aveiro.
Mother: Alda de Mesquita (Mesquita meaning mosque, was a common disguise name of Jews ("New Christians") at the time); Magellan may have been Jewish (though he was raised and considered himself Christian)
<p>
Born in 1480 in the remote mountain parish of Sabrosa
Father's family had a land grant, traced lineage to 11th century French crusader De Magalhais, granted land from Duke of Burgundy
<p>
family was 4th-level Portuguese royalty (out of 5) : fidalgos entitled to a coat of arms and of noble lineage"
him and his brother became royal pages at age ~12 for Queen Leonor in Lisbon
"children educated at the royal courts of Renaissance Europe were taught reading and writing, religion, arithmetic, music and dancing, horsemanship and martial skills. In Lisbon, court pages also were taught  algebra, geometry, astronomy and navigation." -- Joyner, p.34
<p>
WHY MANUEL HATES MAGELLAN:
"At the court of Queen Leonor, pages were trained by the queen's brother, Manuel, the Duke of Beja. Cousin as well as brother-in-law to Joao II, the duke never enjoyed the king's affection or confidence. Manuel was related to the Braganza family, reivals of the House of Avis for the throne of Portugal, and the king distrusted him. After the premature death of the crown prince in 1491, Manuel became the legitimate heir to the throne, but Joao plotted to replace him in the royal succession with his illegitimate son, Jorge. The court split into 2 factions: one, including the queen, recognized Duke Manuel as the legitimate heir, while the other supported the king in his wish to be succeeded by Prince Jorge. Since the Magellan family was loyal to King Joao, Magellan's relationship with Manuel was strained from the start. The antipathy that poisoned their later relations may well have stemmed from this source." -- Joyner, p.34
<p>
"King Joao had enthusiastically resumed the policy of encouraging maritime exploration initiated by Prince Henry." -- Joyner, p.35
<p>
"In Lisbon, supercilious peers regarded the youthful [Magellan] as a country bumpkin. His resentment at their snobbery and the exciting stories of overseas discoveries heard at court combined to make young Magellan dream of winning honor and prestige with daring exploits in exotic, faraway lands." -- Joyner, p.36
<p>
"[Magellan] was probably employed at Casa da India e da Guinea, an annex of the royal palace...
 he had ready access to the privileged information stored at Casa de India, and he eagerly
 digested the new geographic concepts and navigational theories propounded by members of the 
 Junta dos Matematicos...
 From the pilots, masters and mates who sailed with the exploratory fleets, Magellan learned practical
 aspects of navigation not contained in the discourses of the savants of the Junta. By helping to
 outfit the fleets leaving for India each year, Magellan learned about rigging, caulking, repairing,
 and armaments and about procuring and loading supplies for a long voyage. The more he learned, the
 more he hungered to sail with one of the great fleets." -- Joyner, p.36

Cabral conducted the first substantial exploration of the northeast coast of South America and claimed it for Portugal. While details of Cabral's early life are sketchy, it is known that he came from a minor noble family and received a good education. He was appointed to head an expedition to India in 1500, following Vasco da Gama's newly opened route around Africa.

The name Patagonia comes from the word patagón used by Magellan in 1520 to describe the native people that his expedition thought to be giants. It is now believed the Patagons were actually <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehuelche_people">Tehuelches</a> with an average height of 180 cm (~5′11″) compared to the 155 cm (~5′1″) average for Europeans of the time.
<br>&mdash; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patagonia
<p>
The <em>Patagones or Patagonian giants are a mythical race of people</em>, who first began to appear in early European accounts of the then little-known region and coastline of Patagonia. They were supposed to have exceeded at least double normal human height, some accounts giving heights of 12 to 15 feet (3.7 to 4.6 m) or more. Tales of these improbable people would take a hold over European concepts of the region for some 250 years, until they were substantially debunked at the end of the 18th century.
<p>
The people encountered by Byron were in all likelihood the Tehuelches, indigenous to the region. Later writers consider the Patagonian giants to have been a hoax, or at least an exaggeration and mis-telling of earlier European accounts of the region.
<p>
First mention of these people came from the voyage of Ferdinand Magellan and his crew, who claimed to have seen them while exploring the coastline of South America en route to their circumnavigation of the world in the 1520s. Antonio Pigafetta, one of the expedition's few survivors and the chronicler of Magellan's expedition, wrote in his account about their encounter with natives twice a normal person's height:
<blockquote>
"One day we suddenly saw a naked man of giant stature on the shore of the port, dancing, singing, and throwing dust on his head. The captain-general [i.e., Magellan] sent one of our men to the giant so that he might perform the same actions as a sign of peace. Having done that, the man led the giant to an islet where the captain-general was waiting. When the giant was in the captain-general's and our presence he marveled greatly, and made signs with one finger raised upward, believing that we had come from the sky. He was so tall that we reached only to his waist, and he was well proportioned..."
</blockquote>
Pigafetta also recorded that Magellan had bestowed on these people the name "Patagão" (i.e. "Patagon", or Patagoni in Pigafetta's Italian plural),[1] but did not further elaborate on his reasons for doing so. Since Pigafetta's time the assumption that this derived from pata or foot took hold, and "Patagonia" was interpreted to mean "Land of the Bigfeet". However, this etymology remains questionable, since amongst other things the meaning of the suffix -gon is unclear. Nevertheless, the name "Patagonia" stuck, as did the notion that the local inhabitants were giants. Early maps of the New World afterwards would sometimes attach the label regio gigantum ("region of giants") to the area.
<p>
In 1579, Sir Francis Drake's ship chaplain, Francis Fletcher, wrote about meeting very tall Patagonians.

	"they were short and squat, with breasts hanging down half a fathom, repulsively ugly to Magellan's crews."
<p>

As nomads, Tehuelches lived with limited possessions, as they had to move across long distances. Their rock tools were usually made of obsidian or basalt, as those rocks were not hard enough as to be unmalleable, but neither soft enough as to break easily.[9] Those rocks, however, could only be found at specific regions of the Patagonia, so the Tehuelches had to make long journeys to renew their supplies.
The tehuelches hunted many species in the Patagonia, including whales, sea mammals, small rodents and sea birds; their main hunts were guanacos and Rheas. Both species were usually found at the same places, as the rheas eat the larvaes that grow at the Guanaco's manure.[10] Everything from the guanaco was exploited by the Tehuelches: the meat and blood were used for food, the fat to grease their bodies during winter, and the hide to make clothing and canopies.
There is little vegetal life in the Patagonia, but the Tehuelches gathered fruits that grew during summers. Those fruits were the only sweet foods in their diet.
<p>

Rheas have many uses in South America. Feathers are used for feather dusters, skins are used for cloaks or leather, and their meat is a staple to many people.

Yamanas occupied South of Tierra del Fuego and the Cape Horn while Alakalufs roamed the Magellan Straits and, through the fjords, spread right up to Wellington Island where now stands Perto Den at the edge of Hielo Continental.
It is most probable that the most daring canoed across the lower parts of Hielo Continental to steal women from the Tehuelches who lived on the Eastern steppes.
The ocean part of our trajectory will cover the ancient territories of the Alakalufs.

(or archaically spelt as Aphonso d'Albuquerque and also spelt as Alfonso, and Alphonso; Portuguese pronunciation: [ɐˈfõsu dɨ aɫbuˈkɛɾk]; 1453 – December 16, 1515), 1st Duke of Goa, was a Portuguese fidalgo, or nobleman, an admiral whose military and administrative activities as second governor of Portuguese India conquered and established the Portuguese colonial empire in the Indian Ocean.

After finishing his education, Albuquerque first served in North Africa and in the Mediterranean where he took part in numerous successful campaigns against the Arabs and the Ottomans. His long military career in these fronts meant he had acquired the military experience needed to operate in the newly reached and vastly unexplored Indian Ocean.
<p>
He is generally considered a world conquest military genius,[1][2] given his successful strategy: he attempted to close all the Indian Ocean naval passages to the Atlantic, Red Sea, Persian Gulf, and to the Pacific, transforming it into a Portuguese mare clausum established over the Ottoman power and their Muslim and Hindu allies.[3]
<p>
He was responsible for building numerous fortresses to defend key strategic positions and establishing a net of diplomatic relations. Albuquerque was appointed "Governor and Captain-General of India" and shortly before his death "Duke of Goa", the first Portuguese nobility title landed overseas, by king Manuel I of Portugal, becoming the first Portuguese duke not from the royal family. He was one of the first to commission secure trading relations with China during the Ming Dynasty, also either establishing or improving commercial trades with Siam, Ethiopia, and Persia.
<p>
Albuquerque was known as a prodigious maritime commander, who would often engage with and defeat much larger armies and fleets. For example his capture of Ormuz in 1507 against the Persians was accomplished with an army fifty times smaller. Other famous battles and offensives lead by Albuquerque include the conquest of Goa in 1510 and the capture of Malacca in 1511.
<p>
Centuries after Alexander the Great, he was the first European whose dream of establishing an empire in India, or in Asia for any matter, controlled from abroad, was successfully accomplished.[4] His military and diplomatic contributions are generally regarded as one of the most vital to help the Portuguese create a colonial empire in Asia as well as reaching the spice routes in the South East Asia and the South West Pacific. He became known as The Terrible, The Great, The Caesar of the East, Lion of the Seas, and as The Portuguese Mars.

Columbus, in a desperate effort to induce the natives to continue provisioning him and his hungry men, successfully won the favor of the natives by correctly predicting a lunar eclipse for 29 February 1504, using the Ephemeris of the German astronomer Regiomontanus.
<p>
Under the terms of the Capitulations of Santa Fe, after his first voyage Columbus was appointed Viceroy and Governor of the Indies, which in practice entailed primarily the administration of the colonies in the island of Hispaniola, whose capital was established in Santo Domingo. By the end of his third voyage, Columbus was physically and mentally exhausted: his body was wracked by arthritis and his eyes by ophthalmia. In October 1499, he sent two ships to Spain, asking the Court of Spain to appoint a royal commissioner to help him govern. By then, accusations of tyranny and incompetence on the part of Columbus had also reached the Court.
<p>
While Columbus had always given the conversion of non-believers as one reason for his explorations, he grew increasingly religious in his later years. Probably with the assistance of his son Diego and his friend the Carthusian monk Gaspar Gorricio, Columbus produced two books during his later years: a Book of Privileges (1502), detailing and documenting the rewards from the Spanish Crown to which he believed he and his heirs were entitled, and a Book of Prophecies (1505), in which passages from the Bible were used to place his achievements as an explorer in the context of Christian eschatology.[11]
<p>
In his later years, Columbus demanded that the Spanish Crown give him 10% of all profits made in the new lands, as stipulated in the Capitulations of Santa Fe. Because he had been relieved of his duties as governor, the crown did not feel bound by that contract and his demands were rejected. After his death, his heirs sued the Crown for a part of the profits from trade with America, as well as other rewards. This led to a protracted series of legal disputes known as the pleitos colombinos ("Columbian lawsuits").
<p>
The Book of Prophecies (in Spanish, El Libro de las Profecías) is a compilation of apocalyptical religious revelations written by Christopher Columbus towards the end of his life, probably with the assistance of his friend the Carthusian monk Gaspar Gorricio. It was written between September 1501 and March 1502, with additions until about 1505.[1]
This journal of sorts conveys the medieval notion that in order for the end of the world or the second coming of Jesus Christ to occur, certain events must first be enacted:
1. Christianity must be spread throughout the world.
2. The Garden of Eden must be found - It was the common belief in the Middle Ages that the biblical Garden of Eden must have been on the top of a crag or mountaintop so that it would not have been affected by the first destruction of the world by flood. However, upon arriving in Venezuela in 1498, it is not likely that Columbus would have searched there since he was a student of Scripture, which clearly states that the Garden of Eden was near the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers.
3. A Last Crusade must take back the Holy Land from the Muslims - It was also believed that when Christ comes, he will come back in the place he lived and died; Jerusalem.
4. A Last World Emperor must be chosen - Columbus had chosen, at least in his mind, that the Catholic Monarchs, Ferdinand and Isabella, would fulfill this position due to the vast imperial power and religious conviction the Spanish monarchs claimed. A last world emperor would be necessary to lead the aforementioned crusade against the Muslims and to greet Christ at Jerusalem once the previous steps had been completed.
These notions were not new to Columbus' time period. Medieval monastic writers such as Joachim of Fiore made similar claims and heavily influenced the apocalyptical writings and beliefs of Christopher Columbus.
Many ignore or view this apocalyptical facet of Columbus as myth, however at the close of his life he was very much enthralled in apocalyptic and religious scholarship. Many found Columbus to be mad in his later years[citation needed] and as history notes, he never did see the whole of his visions realized.

one of the most famous and celebrated explorers from the Discovery Ages, being the first European to reach India through sea. This discovery was very significant and paved the way for the Portuguese to establish a long lasting colonial empire in Asia.
<p>
Vasco da Gama, 1st Count of Vidigueira (Portuguese pronunciation: [ˈvaʃku dɐ ˈɡɐmɐ]) (c. 1460 or 1469 – 24 December 1524) was a Portuguese explorer, one of the most successful in the Age of Discovery and the commander of the first ships to sail directly from Europe to India. For a short time in 1524 he was the Governor of Portuguese India, under the title of Viceroy.
<p>
Vasco da Gama returned to Portugal in September 1499 and was richly rewarded as the man who had brought to fruition a plan that had taken eighty years to fulfill. He was given the title "Admiral of the Indian Seas,"[18] and his feudal rights to Sines were confirmed.[19] Manuel I also awarded the perpetual title of Dom (lord) to da Gama, as well as to his brothers and sisters and to all of their descendants.
<p>
In 1519 he became the first Count of Vidigueira, a count title created by King Manuel I of Portugal on a royal decree issued in Évora on December 29, after an agreement with Dom Jaime, Duke of Braganza, who ceded him on payment the towns of Vidigueira and Vila dos Frades. This decree granted Vasco da Gama and his heirs all the revenues and privileges related,[23] thus establishing da Gama as the first Portuguese count (earl) who was not born with royal blood.
<p>
Vasco da Gama inflicted acts of cruelty upon competing traders and local inhabitants.[24][25] During his second voyage to Calicut, da Gama intercepted a ship of Muslim pilgrims at Madayi travelling from Calicut to Mecca. Described by the Portuguese historian Gaspar Correia as one that is unequalled in cold-blooded cruelty, da Gama looted the ship with over 400 pilgrims on board including 50 women, locked in the passengers, the owner and an ambassador from Egypt and burnt them to death. They offered their wealth which 'could ransom all the Christian slaves in the Kingdom of Fez and much more' but were not spared. Da Gama looked on through the porthole and saw the women bringing up their gold and jewels and holding up their babies to beg for mercy.'[26]

Caliban (pron.: /ˈkælɨbæn/ kal-ə-ban) is one of the primary antagonists in William Shakespeare's play <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tempest">The Tempest</a>.
<p>
After his island becomes occupied by Prospero and his cohort, Caliban is forced into servitude. While he is referred to as a calvaluna or mooncalf, a freckled monster, he is the only human inhabitant of the island that is otherwise "not honour'd with a human shape“ (Prospero, I.2.283). In some traditions he is depicted as: a wild man, or a deformed man, or a beast man, or sometimes a mix of fish and man, stemming from the confusion of two of the characters about what he is, found lying on a deserted island. Caliban is the son of Sycorax by (according to Prospero), a devil. Banished from Algiers, Sycorax was left on the isle, pregnant with Caliban, and died before Prospero's arrival. Caliban refers to Setebos as his mother's god. Prospero explains his harsh treatment of Caliban by claiming that after initially befriending him, Caliban attempted to rape Miranda. Caliban confirms this gleefully, saying that if he hadn't been stopped he would have peopled the island with a race of Calibans - "Though dist prevent me, I had peopled else this isle with Calibans"(Act I:ii). Prospero then entraps Caliban and torments him. Resentful of Prospero, Caliban takes Stephano, one of the shipwrecked servants, as a god and as his new master. Caliban learns that Stephano is neither a god nor Prospero's equal in the conclusion of the play, however, and Caliban agrees to obey Prospero again.
<p>
Despite this portrayal, Caliban also has moments in which he delivers memorable speeches, such as in Act 3, Scene 2:
<blockquote>
Be not afeard; the isle is full of noises,<br>
Sounds, and sweet airs, that give delight and hurt not.<br>
Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments<br>
Will hum about mine ears; and sometime voices<br>
That, if I then had waked after long sleep,<br>
Will make me sleep again; and then in dreaming,<br>
The clouds methought would open, and show riches<br>
Ready to drop upon me, that when I waked<br>
I cried to dream again.
</blockquote>
