Though Spain was the core of his possessions, he was never totally assimilated and especially in his earlier years felt as if he were viewed as a foreign prince. He could not speak Spanish very well, as it was not his primary language. Nonetheless, he spent most of his life in Spain, including his final years in a Spanish monastery. Indeed, <b>Charles' motto, <em>Plus Ultra</em> ('Further Beyond'), became the national motto of Spain.</b>

a Portuguese cosmographer, astrologer, and astronomer who was the principal scientific organizer behind Magellan's circumnavigation of the world.
<p>
Born in Covilhã, Kingdom of Portugal, at the end of the fifteenth century, Faleiro and his brother Francisco Faleiro, also a cosmographer, served the Spanish king Charles I in Seville. Faleiro, one of the first to apply the most rigorously scientific method of determining latitude and longitude, had earlier served John II of Portugal and his successor, Manuel I of Portugal.
<p>
<p>
The merchant Christopher de Haro helped Faleiro and Magellan present their proposal before the Spanish royal counselors.
<p>
Faleiro planned to accompany Magellan on his voyage around the world. However, it is said that on the evening prior to embarkation, Faleiro worked out his own horoscope for the voyage. The stars predicted a violent death. Consequently, he remained behind. Other sources claim he went mad before the voyage, and thus did not join the expedition.

<h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patagons">Patagons</a> (mythical) / Tehuelches</h2>

<img src="img/people/Patagons.jpg" height="300" style="float:left">
The name Patagonia comes from the word patagón used by Magellan in 1520 to describe the native people that his expedition thought to be giants. It is now believed the Patagons were actually <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehuelche_people">Tehuelches</a> with an average height of 180 cm (~5′11″) compared to the 155 cm (~5′1″) average for Europeans of the time.
<br>&mdash; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patagonia
<p>
The <em>Patagones or Patagonian giants are a mythical race of people</em>, who first began to appear in early European accounts of the then little-known region and coastline of Patagonia. They were supposed to have exceeded at least double normal human height, some accounts giving heights of 12 to 15 feet (3.7 to 4.6 m) or more. Tales of these improbable people would take a hold over European concepts of the region for some 250 years, until they were substantially debunked at the end of the 18th century.
<p>
The people encountered by Byron were in all likelihood the Tehuelches, indigenous to the region. Later writers consider the Patagonian giants to have been a hoax, or at least an exaggeration and mis-telling of earlier European accounts of the region.
<p>
First mention of these people came from the voyage of Ferdinand Magellan and his crew, who claimed to have seen them while exploring the coastline of South America en route to their circumnavigation of the world in the 1520s. Antonio Pigafetta, one of the expedition's few survivors and the chronicler of Magellan's expedition, wrote in his account about their encounter with natives twice a normal person's height:
<blockquote>
"One day we suddenly saw a naked man of giant stature on the shore of the port, dancing, singing, and throwing dust on his head. The captain-general [i.e., Magellan] sent one of our men to the giant so that he might perform the same actions as a sign of peace. Having done that, the man led the giant to an islet where the captain-general was waiting. When the giant was in the captain-general's and our presence he marveled greatly, and made signs with one finger raised upward, believing that we had come from the sky. He was so tall that we reached only to his waist, and he was well proportioned..."
</blockquote>
Pigafetta also recorded that Magellan had bestowed on these people the name "Patagão" (i.e. "Patagon", or Patagoni in Pigafetta's Italian plural),[1] but did not further elaborate on his reasons for doing so. Since Pigafetta's time the assumption that this derived from pata or foot took hold, and "Patagonia" was interpreted to mean "Land of the Bigfeet". However, this etymology remains questionable, since amongst other things the meaning of the suffix -gon is unclear. Nevertheless, the name "Patagonia" stuck, as did the notion that the local inhabitants were giants. Early maps of the New World afterwards would sometimes attach the label regio gigantum ("region of giants") to the area.
<p>
In 1579, Sir Francis Drake's ship chaplain, Francis Fletcher, wrote about meeting very tall Patagonians.

<h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afonso_de_Albuquerque">Afonso de Albuquerque</a></h2>

(or archaically spelt as Aphonso d'Albuquerque and also spelt as Alfonso, and Alphonso; Portuguese pronunciation: [ɐˈfõsu dɨ aɫbuˈkɛɾk]; 1453 – December 16, 1515), 1st Duke of Goa, was a Portuguese fidalgo, or nobleman, an admiral whose military and administrative activities as second governor of Portuguese India conquered and established the Portuguese colonial empire in the Indian Ocean.

After finishing his education, Albuquerque first served in North Africa and in the Mediterranean where he took part in numerous successful campaigns against the Arabs and the Ottomans. His long military career in these fronts meant he had acquired the military experience needed to operate in the newly reached and vastly unexplored Indian Ocean.
<p>
He is generally considered a world conquest military genius,[1][2] given his successful strategy: he attempted to close all the Indian Ocean naval passages to the Atlantic, Red Sea, Persian Gulf, and to the Pacific, transforming it into a Portuguese mare clausum established over the Ottoman power and their Muslim and Hindu allies.[3]
<p>
He was responsible for building numerous fortresses to defend key strategic positions and establishing a net of diplomatic relations. Albuquerque was appointed "Governor and Captain-General of India" and shortly before his death "Duke of Goa", the first Portuguese nobility title landed overseas, by king Manuel I of Portugal, becoming the first Portuguese duke not from the royal family. He was one of the first to commission secure trading relations with China during the Ming Dynasty, also either establishing or improving commercial trades with Siam, Ethiopia, and Persia.
<p>
Albuquerque was known as a prodigious maritime commander, who would often engage with and defeat much larger armies and fleets. For example his capture of Ormuz in 1507 against the Persians was accomplished with an army fifty times smaller. Other famous battles and offensives lead by Albuquerque include the conquest of Goa in 1510 and the capture of Malacca in 1511.
<p>
Centuries after Alexander the Great, he was the first European whose dream of establishing an empire in India, or in Asia for any matter, controlled from abroad, was successfully accomplished.[4] His military and diplomatic contributions are generally regarded as one of the most vital to help the Portuguese create a colonial empire in Asia as well as reaching the spice routes in the South East Asia and the South West Pacific. He became known as The Terrible, The Great, The Caesar of the East, Lion of the Seas, and as The Portuguese Mars.

This rajah of Mactan called Cilapulapu by Pigafetta ("Ci" meaning "the"), commander of the natives of Mactan who defeated and killed Magellan, has become a local hero.
It is commonly believed locally that Lapu Lapu himself struck the lethal blow to Magellan, and with a bolo.

Caliban (pron.: /ˈkælɨbæn/ kal-ə-ban) is one of the primary antagonists in William Shakespeare's play <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tempest">The Tempest</a>.
<p>
After his island becomes occupied by Prospero and his cohort, Caliban is forced into servitude. While he is referred to as a calvaluna or mooncalf, a freckled monster, he is the only human inhabitant of the island that is otherwise "not honour'd with a human shape“ (Prospero, I.2.283). In some traditions he is depicted as: a wild man, or a deformed man, or a beast man, or sometimes a mix of fish and man, stemming from the confusion of two of the characters about what he is, found lying on a deserted island. Caliban is the son of Sycorax by (according to Prospero), a devil. Banished from Algiers, Sycorax was left on the isle, pregnant with Caliban, and died before Prospero's arrival. Caliban refers to Setebos as his mother's god. Prospero explains his harsh treatment of Caliban by claiming that after initially befriending him, Caliban attempted to rape Miranda. Caliban confirms this gleefully, saying that if he hadn't been stopped he would have peopled the island with a race of Calibans - "Though dist prevent me, I had peopled else this isle with Calibans"(Act I:ii). Prospero then entraps Caliban and torments him. Resentful of Prospero, Caliban takes Stephano, one of the shipwrecked servants, as a god and as his new master. Caliban learns that Stephano is neither a god nor Prospero's equal in the conclusion of the play, however, and Caliban agrees to obey Prospero again.
<p>
Despite this portrayal, Caliban also has moments in which he delivers memorable speeches, such as in Act 3, Scene 2:
<blockquote>
Be not afeard; the isle is full of noises,<br>
Sounds, and sweet airs, that give delight and hurt not.<br>
Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments<br>
Will hum about mine ears; and sometime voices<br>
That, if I then had waked after long sleep,<br>
Will make me sleep again; and then in dreaming,<br>
The clouds methought would open, and show riches<br>
Ready to drop upon me, that when I waked<br>
I cried to dream again.
