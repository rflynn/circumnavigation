The Sinulog Festival is an annual cultural and religious festival held on the third Sunday of January in Cebu City The Sinulog commemorates the Filipino people's acceptance of Christianity (specifically, Roman Catholicism), and their rejection of their former animist beliefs. The first of these conversions happened in 1521 on the island of Cebu, when Rajah Humabon and his queen Amihan (Humamay) were baptised along
with their subjects, becoming Carlos and Juana of Cebu.
