The history of Guam involves phases including the early arrival of people known today as the ancient Chamorros, the development of "pre-contact" society, Spanish colonization, and the present American rule of the island. Guam's history of colonialism is the longest among the Pacific islands.

Burials
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Jesuit missionary Fr. Diego Luis de San Vitores also described Chamorro burial practices in the early years of the Catholic mission.  According to San Vitores, funerals were remarkable, “with many tears, fasting and a great sounding of shells.”  The mourning period would last about a week or more—depending upon the social status of the deceased—with meals being shared around the grave.

The grave itself was decorated with flowers, palms, shells and other valuables.  The deceased’s mother would cut off a lock of the individual’s hair as a memento, and count the days of her loved one’s death by tying a knot on a cord around her neck.
