auto-da-fé (also auto da fé and auto de fe)
	the ritual of public penance of condemned heretics and apostates that took place when the Spanish Inquisition or the Portuguese Inquisition had decided their punishment, followed by the execution by the civil authorities of the sentences imposed. Both 'auto de fe' in medieval Spanish and 'auto da fé' in Portuguese mean "act of faith".
As the burning at the stake for heresy was perhaps the most profound aspect of many autos-da-fé, this particular aspect of it, that is, the act of burning at the stake eventually became the primary meaning of the phrase in popular usage, despite the fact that such was not its original meaning.

crier (i.e. "town crier"):
	how exactly did this work?

gibbet:
	 a gallows-type structure from which the dead bodies of executed criminals were hung on public display to deter other existing or potential criminals. In earlier times, up to the late 17th century, live gibbeting also took place, in which the criminal was placed alive in a metal cage and left to starve to death.[1] To gibbet a criminal is to display the criminal on a gibbet.[2] This practice is also called "hanging in chains".
