gibbet:
	 a gallows-type structure from which the dead bodies of executed criminals were hung on public display to deter other existing or potential criminals. In earlier times, up to the late 17th century, live gibbeting also took place, in which the criminal was placed alive in a metal cage and left to starve to death.[1] To gibbet a criminal is to display the criminal on a gibbet.[2] This practice is also called "hanging in chains".
